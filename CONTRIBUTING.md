Pull requests are welcome, but please update the documentation and tests.  The tests are executed by running the default `grunt` task.  The tests will probably fail if your changes affect the generated output - please review the differences and when you're happy _temporarily_ edit the `if (false)` in [tests/generation.js#verify()](blob/master/tests/generation.js#L15) and re-run the tests.
