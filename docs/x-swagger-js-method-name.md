# x-swagger-js-method-name
By default, javascript method names are generated by concatenating the HTTP method name and path segments.
Generally, the generated names read well, but sometimes they turn out wrong:

```javascript
// A PUT to this path in a swagger schema:  /records/{id}/meta
// is intended to update a "meta" property on a specific "Record" entity.
// ...swagger-js-codegen generates a method named:
MyApi.prototype.putEntitiesByIdMeta = function(parameters) {
```

If you would like to provide your own method names, use the `x-swagger-js-method-name` field at the method level

```yaml
  /records/{id}/meta:
    put:
      x-swagger-js-method-name: updateRecordMetaData
      parameters:
      - name: id
       in: path
       ...
```
